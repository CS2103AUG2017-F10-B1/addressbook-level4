<p>Adds a relationship between two persons in Intelli.<br>

<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The indexes of the persons are based on the most recent listing shown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The direction of the relationship can only be <code>directed</code> or <code>undirected</code>. The direction is case-insensitive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order of the indexes matters only when the direction is <code>directed</code>, as the relationship points from the person with FROM_INDEX to the person with TO_INDEX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At any point of time there will be at most 1 relationship between any two persons. If adding a different relationship from the existing one between two persons is attempted, upon the addition the previous relationship between these two persons will be removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>NAME</code> referring to the name of the relationship <strong>can only be alphanumeric</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CONFIDENCE_ESTIMATE</code> refers to the confidence estimate the user gives to the relationship. <code>CONFIDENCE_ESTIMATE</code> <strong>can only be numbers from 0 to 100 inclusive</strong>.</p>

<li>
<p><code>addRelationship 2 3 undirected n/husband and wife ce/100</code>

<h4 id="design-considerations"><a class="link" href="#design-considerations">Design Considerations</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Implementation for addRelationship command<br>
<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> The command is implemented by adding one additional attribute <code>UniqueRelationshipList</code> to each person.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Implementation is easier as it follows the same logic as having the UniqueTagList.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> All the relationships in the address book are not organized into a single entity (e.g. an adjacency list) which is more intuitive when the implementation involves a graph.<br>
<strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Organize all the relationships into a single entity, instead of making them into lists under persons in the address book.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> It is more intuitive to organize all the relationships into a single entity when the implementation involves a graph.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Maintenance of this single entity of graph can be costly as it can become massive.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Currently a person is identified by his/her index in the most recent listing. As the indexes of persons change, matching the relationship to the correct persons involved will be a headache.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Record of the relationship in the address book<br>
<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> A relationship between two persons are recorded in both persons' <code>UniqueRelationshipList</code>.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Easy search of the relationship in the address book as both parties involved in the relationship have record of it.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Maintenance of the relationships is troublesome as a single relationship has to be added, modified or deleted twice.<br>
<strong>Alternative 2:</strong> A relationship between two persons are recorded in the <code>fromPerson&#8217;s `UniqueRelationshipList</code>, except that when the relationship is undirected, it is recorded twice under both parties.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Easy maintenance of the relationships.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> More scenarios to consider when performing actions to the relationship. Hence, it will lead to more difficult implementation.</p>

<h4 id="design-considerations-3"><a class="link" href="#design-considerations-3">Design Considerations</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Implementation for removeTag command<br>
<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> The command is implemented using methods which remove the tag from each person&#8217;s tag list.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Implementation is modular and less dependent on methods used for other commands.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> More tedious to implement since it is not making use of the existing resources such as <code>edit</code> command.<br>
<strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Adapt current <code>edit</code> command so that removing the tag is done by editing every person&#8217;s tag list.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Making use of existing resources and easier implementation.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> More dependency between commands and the relationship between <code>edit</code> and <code>remove</code> is not clear.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Type of command implemented<br>
<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> <code>removeTag</code> command extends <code>UndoableCommand</code> instead of <code>Command</code>.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Accidental removal of tags can be recovered.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Additional memory needed for recording the previous stage of the address book.<br>
<strong>Alternative 2:</strong> <code>removeTag</code> command extends <code>Command</code>.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> No additional memory needed for recording the previous stage of the address book.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> As the removal of Tag is from all the persons in address book, an accidental removal can be disastrous if the user does not intend a complete removal.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Removal of the tag from all instead of some by user&#8217;s choice<br>
<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> The command currently does not support the removal of a tag from persons specified in the user input.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Easier implementation since it does not deal with the parsing of more user input.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> The user cannot remove the tags from a few specific people in one command. <br>
<strong>Alternative 2:</strong> The command allows the user input to specify the persons from whom the tag should be removed.<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> The user can remove the tags from a few specific people in one command.<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Implementation is more difficult as parsing of additional user input required. It is also unlikely for user to remove the tag from many persons at once, hence there is a function overlap with <code>edit</code> command.</p>
